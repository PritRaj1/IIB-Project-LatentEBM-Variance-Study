    "- [[1605.08803] Density estimation using Real NVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803)\n",

    "Given my unfamiliarity, I supplemented my understanding with the authors’ corresponding blog posts. I also explored the structure of their repositories, as well as Justin’s exemplar repositories, to better understand how to structure any machine learning codebases. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, I reorganized the tutorial on the score-based Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) model, which was featured in a Colab notebook in the blog post below. This helped solidify my understanding of how professional research repositories are structured.\n",

    "Following the preliminary readings completed over summer regarding basic ideas in generative modelling, as well as the review of standard codebases and modular coding practices, today was dedicated towards reading around expectation maximisation, mixture models, and denoising diffusion models. I also began my implementation of a simple diffusion model. After struggling with this for some time, I have arranged a meeting with Justin in two days, to get guidance.\n",
